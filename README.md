# Todo-Web-Application with Component

This repository provides a small web-application consisting of a
pedestal-service and a database connection to persist todo-items. These two components are composed in a system with Stuart Sierra's [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library.

## Usage

The production code runs with a postgres-database. You can create a database
with the correct settings with this command:

    docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=clojure -e POSTGRES_USER=clojure -e POSTGRES_DB=clojure -p 5432:5432 postgres:10-alpine

Then start the system:

    lein run

The service is then accessible under http://localhost:8080

### Tests

There are two sample tests, which can be run with

    lein test
